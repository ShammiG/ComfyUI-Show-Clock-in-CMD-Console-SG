# ComfyUI Show Clock in CMD Console SG


Simple node that **automatically intializes** at ComfyUI startup and shows a timestamp for tasks. **No extra dependencies needed**.            
This eliminates the need to add a Node to every workflow.

**Shows 24H clock time in CMD Console** when :
**Process starts**, Process **ends**, if Process is **interrupted** (both through UI and with Ctrl+C) and if Process **fails**.       

Also useful when there are several processes in queue and you want to find out at what specific time did certain process started or ended.         
        
**Color coded** for easier viewing, this also makes it easier finding any earlier interruptions or Processes in console.
                  
Processing time is displayed in **Minutes and seconds even if process takes less than 10 minutes** (By default, comfyUI shows only in seconds if processing takes less than 10 minutes.)
